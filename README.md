[Capistrano](http://capistranorb.com/) SCM strategies (sparse).

Capistrano SCM Strategy is a home for additional strategies utilising
Capistrano's pluggable strategy approach. Only Capistrano 3 is supported.
Currently, the only strategy is `Git::Sparse`. But why not blend your magic? :)

More sleep lost by [tiredpixel](http://www.tiredpixel.com).


## Installation

Install using:

    gem 'capistrano-scm-strategy', '~> 0.1'

The default Ruby version supported is defined in `.ruby-version`.


## Usage

Require all strategies (they are namespaced so don't fret :) ):

    # Capfile
    
    require 'capistrano/scm/strategy'

Choose a strategy using Capistrano's pluggable nature:

    set :git_strategy, Capistrano::Scm::Strategy::Git::Sparse

The strategy option is named `:SCM_strategy`, where `SCM` is the SCM set or
defaulted by `:scm`. So, for Subversion, use `:svn_strategy`.

That's it!


## Strategies

These strategies are available:

- `Capistrano::Scm::Strategy::Git::Sparse` :
  A sparse Git strategy.

## Growing Like Flowers

Dear Me, Here is a vague wishlist:

- `Capistrano::Scm::Strategy::Hg::Sparse` :
  A sparse Mercurial strategy.

- `Capistrano::Scm::Strategy::Svn::Sparse` :
  A sparse Subversion strategy.
